For my projection mapping project, I would like to project pixelated city life onto the boxes or squares. 
The I would like to use 3 stacked boxes and 1 on each side disconnected from the boxes. The first 
box would be the ground level that shows the out of the buidling. The 2nd box would be the middle
of the apartments. The 3rd stacking box would be the top, maybe a balcony scene. The boxes on
the left and right can have different gifs of city life. I would only be needing the boxes
for this project. There wouldn't be too much trouble making this project, I just need to create some gifs if i
needed to.
