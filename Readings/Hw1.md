The Founder

	When I started the game, I  started off by selecting the Information company. After the tutorial I started

to use focus on ads and website building. I hired many programmers and designers and started to build slowly.

Fighting the competition wasnt as bad as I thought. When I won the fight, I ended up with surplus. Even when I

lost to them, I gained small but it wasnt too bad. I had to be patient too because too much spending could have

easily sent me into the red. Management of my own money wasn't too hard but I couldnt rush anything I did, and

I needed extra workers incase situations arose such as servers crashing. Overall the game was fun and does teach

about managing a start up company. Since I started off with my partner being someone who was passionate, they were

easier to amnage despite not having as much money to start off with. THis gives a good idea of what a startup

company looks like at the start and hwo to slowly grow your business.
