# Project Proposal

###  A Project where anyone either through twitter or a nother site can vote to make a deciosion happening within a game environment. The viewers themseles will be able to control what happens in the game. With twitch, its possible to easilhy show the effects of the choices people make. I am deciding between a random whacky  game or a game where people can decide what happens to the city.
